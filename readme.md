# HeartHero
This is an App that I have co-created with @sofiia2002 in 9 hours during the E-health hackathon in Warsaw!

## How to run it
Install Expo, depdendencies and then run:
`expo start --tunnel`
to start the app.

Don't mind the code quality - we only had about 9 hours to create it from scratch!
